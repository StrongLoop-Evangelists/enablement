# AngelHack 2017

[StrongLoop](https://strongloop.com) has always been deeply engaged with and committed to the developer community and we are happy to take part in hack-a-thons and other developer-focused events.

[LoopBack](https://loopback.io) is an open-source tool for building [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) APIs quickly and easily! Built on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com), the most widely-used Node web framework, LoopBack helps you create all the basic CRUD APIs you need and connects easily to all major databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more). Built-in support for extensions such as custom methods and authorization makes LoopBack a fantastic choice to scale with you from prototype to production!

- Blazing fast API development
- Free and Open-Source
- Flexible and extensible

## Win with LoopBack!

LoopBack is great at hackathons and we're here to put our money where our mouth is: use LoopBack in your application and you could win awesome prizes. The team that uses LoopBack the most extensively will be rewarded if they complete the self service [LoopBack Rewards Framework](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1orpjhCstdrlE21C2Jpy0ohiOIV3bZbPMzEzFCP8VDGY) scorecard, which should only take a couple minutes to complete.
