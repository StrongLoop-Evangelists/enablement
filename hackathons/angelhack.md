# AngelHack 2017

[StrongLoop](https://strongloop.com) has always been deeply engaged with and committed to the developer community and we are happy to take part in hack-a-thons and other developer-focused events.

[LoopBack](https://loopback.io) is an open source tool for rapidly building [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) API applications. In addition to the speed it provides for quickly developing RESTful CRUD API endpoints, LoopBack is built on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com), the most widely used Node.js web framework, which makes serving web UIs a breeze. LoopBack is also very extensible, so whatever your application needs should be within reach.

## Win with LoopBack!

LoopBack is great at hackathons and we're here to put our money where our mouth is: use LoopBack in your application and you could win awesome prizes. The team that uses LoopBack the most extensively will be rewarded if they complete the self service [LoopBack Rewards Framework](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1orpjhCstdrlE21C2Jpy0ohiOIV3bZbPMzEzFCP8VDGY) scorecard, which should only take a couple minutes to complete.
